# Intro - OSM

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative platform where volunteers worldwide contribute to continually enhancing the
world's most accessible map.

# Problem Statement

The openness of OSM also poses challenges, notably the proliferation of vandalism cases within user contributions. To
address this, this thesis aims to develop a real-time machine learning solution to flag potential vandalism in OSM
contributions as they occur.

# Proposed Thesis Framework

This repo consists of a master thesis code of a real-time ML vandalism notification system tailored to OSM's Kafka
stream. The aim is to dynamically analyzing user updates to detect anomalies indicative of potential vandalism in
real-time.
