Reasoning for not using Retentive Networks (RetNets):

1. **RetNets are primarily designed for sequence modeling**:
    - Retentive Networks are indeed designed for tasks that require capturing long-term dependencies in sequences, such
      as time series forecasting or language modeling. Since your problem is primarily a **binary classification task**
      based on feature engineering, the sequential aspect of RetNets doesn't bring added value. Your features (
      changeset, user, and edit characteristics) aren't inherently sequential like text or time-series data.

2. **No advantage to applying a recurrent approach**:
    - You highlight that your input data does not change in length over time, nor does it exhibit a strong sequential
      dependency. This makes the recurrent nature of RetNets unnecessary, as recurrent approaches like RNNs or RetNets
      shine when inputs have dependencies over a sequence. In your case, this complexity doesn't provide a meaningful
      advantage.

3. **Input token length is short and fixed**:
    - The benefit of RetNets lies in handling long sequences efficiently, especially when token length grows over time.
      Since your input data consists of contributions with fixed features (changeset, user, etc.), the length and
      structure don’t grow in a way that RetNets are optimized to handle. As a result, RetNets’ strengths (managing long
      sequences) are not applicable to your use case.

4. **Optimized for sequence outputs vs. binary classification**:
    - RetNets are optimized for sequence outputs, such as text generation or sequence prediction, whereas your task is
      binary classification (vandalism vs. non-vandalism). The architectural complexity of RetNets, focused on producing
      sequential outputs, would be overkill and inefficient for a binary outcome like yours. Simpler, more appropriate
      models (like tree-based models or neural networks) are better suited for this kind of task.

### Additional Points:

- You could also explain that **RetNets are not as well-documented or tested** in non-sequential tasks, which introduces
  uncertainty. Since your project involves a structured dataset with mixed features (numerical, categorical), tree-based
  models like **XGBoost or LightGBM**, or simpler neural networks, are likely to yield better results.

### Conclusion:

These points provide a solid technical justification for why RetNets aren't suitable for your task. It's clear, specific
to your dataset and classification task, and demonstrates that you've thought carefully about model selection.
