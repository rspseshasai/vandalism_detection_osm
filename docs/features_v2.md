The features you've implemented for detecting vandalism in OpenStreetMap (OSM) contributions are designed to capture
various aspects of user behavior, geometric changes, temporal characteristics, contribution content, spatial context,
and historical edits. Below is a detailed explanation of each feature type, its theoretical foundation, and its
importance in detecting vandalism or low-quality contributions.

### 1. **User Behavior Features**

#### 1.1 **User Edit Frequency**

- **Definition**: Number of edits made by the user within a certain time frame (e.g., the last 7 days).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Users who engage in frequent edits might be more familiar with editing protocols or could also
  be more prone to "edit fatigue," where they make mistakes due to volume. Sudden spikes in activity might also be
  suspicious if they diverge from typical user behavior.
- **Importance**: High-frequency editors might have more experience, but an unusually high frequency of edits in a short
  time might suggest careless or spam-like behavior, which could be indicative of vandalism.

#### 1.2 **Editor Used**

- **Definition**: The type of editor used to make the contribution (e.g., JOSM, iD, etc.).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Some editors are designed for experienced users (e.g., JOSM), while others are simpler and more
  prone to user mistakes (e.g., iD). Vandals might prefer simpler editors.
- **Importance**: Helps differentiate between experienced and novice users, as some editors are more prone to errors or
  abuse.

### 2. **Geometric Features**

#### 2.1 **Area Delta**

- **Definition**: The change in the area of the feature after the edit.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Large or unexpected changes in area may indicate vandalism or a mistake, especially if the
  previous area was stable over time.
- **Importance**: Detects unusually large edits that may not have been thoroughly checked or verified, thus raising
  suspicion.

#### 2.2 **Length Delta**

- **Definition**: The change in length for linear features (e.g., roads or boundaries).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Similar to area changes, large modifications to linear features may suggest either substantial
  improvement or suspicious activity.
- **Importance**: Identifies significant alterations in road networks or boundaries, which could be errors or deliberate
  acts of vandalism.

#### 2.3 **Bounding Box Size**

- **Definition**: The size of the bounding box around the edited feature, calculated as \((x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_
  {max} - y_{min})\).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Features with extreme bounding box sizes may indicate issues like mapping errors,
  over-exaggeration of edits, or attempts to affect large areas.
- **Importance**: Helps flag geometrically out-of-bounds edits, which are often indicative of large-scale vandalism.

#### 2.4 **Geometry Validity**

- **Definition**: Whether the geometry of the feature is valid (binary feature).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Invalid geometry may result from either unintentional errors or malicious edits. For example,
  self-intersecting polygons or unclosed ways could indicate sloppy edits or intentional sabotage.
- **Importance**: Ensures that the data adheres to OSM's geometric standards, and invalid geometries are often
  problematic.

### 3. **Temporal Features**

#### 3.1 **Time Since Last Edit**

- **Definition**: The time difference between the current contribution and the user's last edit.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Users who consistently contribute might be more reliable. A long time between contributions
  might indicate that the user is unfamiliar with recent editing guidelines, whereas very short intervals might indicate
  spammy behavior.
- **Importance**: Helps to evaluate whether the user's contribution pattern is steady or erratic, with erratic behaviors
  often linked to vandalism.

#### 3.2 **Edit Time of Day**

- **Definition**: The time of day the contribution was made.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Certain times (e.g., late at night) might correlate with higher vandalism rates or careless
  edits due to user fatigue.
- **Importance**: Helps identify suspicious contributions made at unusual times, which may correlate with low-quality or
  malicious edits.

### 4. **Contribution Content Features**

#### 4.1 **Number of Tags Added/Removed/Modified**

- **Definition**: The count of tags that were added, removed, or modified in the edit.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Sudden or large-scale changes in tags might signal vandalism or unintentional mistakes,
  especially if critical tags are altered.
- **Importance**: Helps detect substantial alterations in metadata, which might point to attempts to inject false or
  misleading information.

#### 4.2 **Specific Tags Changed**

- **Definition**: Binary flags indicating whether certain critical tags (e.g., `name`, `boundary`, `population`) were
  changed.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Critical tags like names or boundaries are more likely to be targeted in vandalism or mistakes.
  For example, changing a cityâ€™s name might indicate serious vandalism.
- **Importance**: Flags changes to sensitive tags, as these are more likely to cause significant disruption if
  vandalized.

### 5. **Spatial Features**

#### 5.1 **Bounding Box Range (X and Y)**

- **Definition**: The width (`xmax - xmin`) and height (`ymax - ymin`) of the bounding box.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Disproportionate bounding boxes might suggest erroneous data or incorrect feature mapping,
  especially if the dimensions are abnormally large or small.
- **Importance**: Captures spatial anomalies that could indicate significant mistakes or intentional distortion of
  geographic data.

#### 5.2 **Centroid (X and Y Coordinates)**

- **Definition**: The centroid coordinates of the edited feature.
- **Theoretical Basis**: The location of the centroid can help detect shifts in geographic data, which may be
  deliberate (vandalism) or unintentional.
- **Importance**: Detects significant geographic changes or movement of features.

#### 5.3 **Country Count**

- **Definition**: The number of countries associated with the contribution (usually 1, but complex features might cross
  borders).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Cross-border edits may require special attention since they involve multiple administrative
  regions and could be prone to mistakes.
- **Importance**: Helps detect unusual edits that span multiple countries or regions.

### 6. **Contextual and Historical Features**

#### 6.1 **Historical Validity**

- **Definition**: Whether similar changes have been made to the feature in the past (based on historical edit data).
- **Theoretical Basis**: Features with frequent modifications may be contentious or problematic, increasing the
  likelihood of vandalism or low-quality edits.
- **Importance**: Identifies features that are frequently changed, signaling possible issues or vandalism patterns.

### 7. **Derived Features**

#### 7.1 **Tag Density**

- **Definition**: The number of tags per unit area of the feature.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Overly dense tagging may indicate excessive or unnecessary detailing, possibly resulting from
  inexperienced users or deliberate over-complication.
- **Importance**: Helps flag overly detailed or unnecessarily complex edits, which may be indicative of low-quality
  contributions.

#### 7.2 **Change Ratio**

- **Definition**: The ratio of area before and after the edit.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Large changes in feature size may indicate vandalism, especially if the change is
  disproportionate or unjustified.
- **Importance**: Detects large, potentially suspicious alterations in geographic features.

### 8. **Changeset Features**

#### 8.1 **Changeset Comment Length**

- **Definition**: The length of the comment provided in the changeset.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Short or vague comments might indicate a lack of justification for the edit, which could be a
  sign of vandalism or low-quality contributions.
- **Importance**: Helps assess the intent behind an edit. Detailed comments generally correlate with more careful and
  legitimate edits.

#### 8.2 **Source Reliability**

- **Definition**: A binary indicator of whether the source of the contribution is considered reliable.
- **Theoretical Basis**: Contributions based on trusted sources (e.g., Bing, Esri imagery) are likely to be more
  accurate, while edits citing unknown or unreliable sources may be less trustworthy.
- **Importance**: Helps identify edits made with reliable sources, which are generally less likely to be vandalism.

### **Overall Importance of Feature Engineering in Vandalism Detection**

These features are crucial for creating a robust system for detecting vandalism in OSM. By capturing a wide range of
user, geometric, temporal, content, spatial, and historical factors, we can build a more comprehensive picture of each
contribution's legitimacy. These features also allow for machine learning models to distinguish between legitimate edits
and vandalism by identifying patterns that correlate with low-quality or malicious changes. In this way, we can maintain
the integrity of the OSM database and ensure that it continues to serve as a reliable resource for geographic data.
